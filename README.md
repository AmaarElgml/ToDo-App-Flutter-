## Getting Started

# Three-tier architecture 
Three-tier architecture is one of the mainly used architecture for developing applications. This architecture is also known as N-tier architecture or multi architecture.
In three tier architecture these are the main layers,

1- Presentation tier : User Interface is implemented here. It is the top most layer. The function of this layer is to translate tasks and results into a form of that user can understand it. Ex: Console , GUI(Graphical User Interface)

2- Logic tier: Also known as the domain layer. This tier contains all the business logic of the the application. Algorithms, Data manipulations are implemented here.

3- Data tier: This tier store and retrieve data from database or file system. The data from this tier are send to logic layer for processing. API calls are also implemented in this tier
